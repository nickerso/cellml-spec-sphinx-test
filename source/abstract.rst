   This document is an unofficial working draft. The below describes
   the intended status of the specification, and not its current status.

   This document specifies version 1.2 of `CellML <http://www.cellml.org/>`_,
   an `XML <http://www.w3.org/XML/>`_-based language for
   describing and exchanging mathematical models.

   This is the *normative* specification of CellML. It is intended to
   provide the minimum amount of information needed to describe CellML.
   An |informative-specification|_ is available which is annotated with
   much more explanatory material.

.. |informative-specification| replace:: *informative* specification
.. _informative-specification: http://www.cellml.org/

.. todo::

   Provide a 'proper' URL for the informative version of the specification.
