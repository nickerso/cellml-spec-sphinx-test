The relationship\_ref element information item
==============================================

Relationship\_ref element information items (referred to in this
specification as relationship\_ref elements) are element information
items in the CellML 1.1 namespace with local name equal to
relationship\_ref.

Specific information items
--------------------------

1. Every relationship\_ref element MUST contain exactly one attribute
   information item with local name relationship. This limit of one
   attribute information item SHALL apply without regard to the
   namespace the attribute information item is in, and SHALL, to the
   extent that it conflicts, override the ordinary rules for extension
   information items.

2. In the event that the relationship attribute is in
   the empty namespace, it MUST either take the value encapsulation or
   containment. 

3. There MUST NOT exist a sibling
   relationship\_ref element such that the namespace of the relationship
   attribute on the sibling element is identical to the namespace of the
   relationship attribute on this element, and the value of the
   relationship attribute on the sibling element is identical to the
   value of the relationship attribute on this element.

4. A relationship\_ref element MAY contain an attribute in the empty
   namespace with local name ``name``. In this case it MUST NOT have a
   relationship attribute in the empty namespace with value encapsulation.
   The value of the name attribute MUST be a valid CellML identifier.
