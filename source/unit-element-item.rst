The unit element information item
=================================

Unit element information items (referred to in this specification as
unit elements) are element information items in the CellML 1.1 namespace
with local name equal to unit, and with a units element as their parent.

Specific information items
--------------------------

1. Every unit element MUST contain a units attribute information item in
   the empty namespace. The value of the units attribute MUST be a valid
   units reference, as defined in ?.

   1. The units element inclusion digraph SHALL be a conceptual digraph
      defined for the purpose of the constraint in the next paragraph,
      and SHALL contain one node for every units element in the CellML
      Model. The units element inclusion digraph SHALL contain an arc
      from units element A to units element B if and only if units
      element A contains a unit element with units attribute value that
      is a units reference to units element B.

   2. The value of the units attribute MUST NOT be such that the units
      element inclusion digraph contains one or more cycles.

2. A unit element MAY contain any of the following attribute information
   items in the empty namespace:

   1. The prefix attribute. If present, the value of the attribute MUST
      meet the constraints specified in ?.

   2. The offset attribute. If present, the value of the attribute MUST
      be a real number string. If the attribute is present and has value
      other than a real number string representing 0, then this unit
      element MUST NOT have any sibling unit elements, and the value of
      the exponent attribute, if present, MUST be a real number string
      representing 1.

   3. The multiplier attribute. If present, the value of the attribute
      MUST be a real number string.

   4. The exponent attribute. If present, the value of the attribute
      MUST be a real number string.
